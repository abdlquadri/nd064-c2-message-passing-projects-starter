1. I extracted the LocationService into its own module to take advantage of separation concerns to enable horizontal scaling due to load expected from location events.
2. I extracted the Connection and Person services into a single modules to make the refactor migration simpler.
3. I also refactored LocationService from REST to gRPC because we will need to accomodate for large influx of data.
4. The current should be enabled in future to send location data as gRPC requests.(Since the current client does not send location, I leave the implementation as is.)
5. I have installed Kafka cluster in kubernetes.
