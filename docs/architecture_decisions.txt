1. I extracted the LocationService into its own module and made it gRPC to take advantage of separation concerns to enable horizontal scaling due to load expected from location events.
2. I extracted the Connection and Person services into a separate modules to further the microservice architecture.
3. I also made the generate gRPC fies into a separate module for reuse.
4. I also refactored LocationService from REST to gRPC because we will need to accomodate for large influx of data.
5. The current client should be enabled in future to send location data as gRPC requests.(Since the current client does not send location, I leave the implementation as is.)
6. I have installed Kafka cluster in kubernetes.
7. I implemented Kafka queue for the location data. This serves as a buffer in anticipation of high location data volume.
